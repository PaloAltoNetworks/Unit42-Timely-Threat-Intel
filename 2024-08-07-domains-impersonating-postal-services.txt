2024-08-07 (WEDNESDAY): DOMAINS IMPERSONATING POSTAL SERVICES

AUTHORS:

- Keerthiraj Nagaraj, Nabeel Mohamed

NOTES:

- Since late last year, we have been monitoring phishing campaigns impersonating various postal services across the world.
- We find many newly-registered domains (NRDs) every day from these campaigns.
- These campaigns often use SMS text messages to send phishing URLs as an initial attack vector. This is often called "smishing."
- We often see more than 200 hits on malicious domains for web sites impersonating postal services each day.
- Although these sites mostly impersonate the US Postal Service, we also find other sites impersonating other nations like:
  - Australia
  - Brazil
  - Canada
  - India
  - Ireland
  - Israel
  - United Kingdom
