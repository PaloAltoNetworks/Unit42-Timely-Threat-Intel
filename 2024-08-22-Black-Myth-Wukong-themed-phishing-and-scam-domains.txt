2024-08-22 (THURSDAY): SUSPICIOUS & MALICIOUS DOMAINS USING "BLACK MYTH: WUKONG" THEME

- Fans of the new action RPG 'Black Myth: Wukong' are being targeted through newly-regsitered domains (NRDs).
- Phishing, crypto scams and illegal gambling linked to Wukong-themed NRDs are on the rise. 
- We had noticed a spike in NRDs after a trailer for the game appeared at The Game Awards in December 2023.
- With the game's official release earlier this week, we expect a new wave of cyber threats may hit.
